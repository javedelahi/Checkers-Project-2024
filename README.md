My thought process:
This project uses Playwright to automate the interaction with a Checkers game. After navigating to the site, I first verified the site using the “confirmSite” function - this validates to make sure the URL matches the website. Then, I proceeded to make five legal orange moves using the “makeAMove” function. This incorporates the validation of the game rules using the if and else statements. I then took a blue piece in the fourth move. After the game was finished using the fifth move.  I then used the “restartGame” function - this validates that the game has restarted / reset using the if and else statement of the prompt that appears when a game is restarted/ reset.
